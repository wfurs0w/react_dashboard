The project was created with React, Typescript, SCSS.

In this project, you can see graphs that display the value of cryptocurrencies depending on the year (the data is not real).
You can move these graphics around the page and resize them.

For this, the [react-grid-layout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-grid-layout) and the [recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) library were used.
